# Arduino Adafruit NeoPixel game
The project presented here is a simple game created using the Arduino UNO microcontroller.
After starting the game, two pixels light up on the LED strip, and the player can change the colour of one of them
using a potentiometer. The player's task is to choose the colour of the pixel so that they both light up with the same color.
Once the player has confirmed their choice, the game can give the point, which is shown by turning on one of the four, green LED diode attached to the system.
It happens if the choice made by the player is within the specified range Îµ.
The player makes his choice four times in one game, so he can score 4 points. The game is is won when all of them have been scored.
